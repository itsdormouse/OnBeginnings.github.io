      In life, the number of beginnings
     </p>
     <p>
       is exactly equal to the number of endings:
     </p>
     <p>
       no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.

   <span1>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. 
   Not every poem is finishe-one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, 
   but it is the ending of a poem without an end.   
   </span1>
   <br>
   <br>
   <span2>
   Paul Valery, the French poet and thinker, once said that <p class="underline">
   no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. </p>
   <br>
   This saying is also attributed to Stephane Mallarme, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.
   </span2>
   <br>
   <br>
   <span3>
   Paul Valery also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: 
   the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.
   </span3>

   <span4>
   In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. 
   That nothing can precede action-no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.
   </span4>
   <br>
   <br>
   <span5>
   <p class="underline">I believe the poem is an act of the mind.</p> I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. 
   Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.
   The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.
